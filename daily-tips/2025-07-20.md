# AWS Cost Tip - 2025-07-20
**Topic:** EC2
**Subtopic:** Right Sizing

## Introduction

Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) is a fundamental building block of AWS services, offering scalable computing capacity in the cloud. A common challenge for many organizations is ensuring that their EC2 instances are appropriately sized for their applications' needs, a practice known as "Right Sizing". Right sizing EC2 instances ensures you are not overpaying for underutilized resources, or under-provisioning, which could lead to poor application performance. Effective right sizing not only reduces costs but also boosts efficiency across your deployments.

## Deep Dive

Right sizing involves analyzing the needs of your applications and matching them with the most cost-effective and performance-optimized EC2 instances. This process is crucial because choosing the wrong instance type or size can lead to higher operational costs or reduced application performance.

### Why Right Size?

- **Cost Efficiency**: Ensure you're only paying for what you use. Over-provisioned instances lead to unnecessary expenses.
- **Performance Optimization**: Under-provisioned instances can cause poor application performance and a bad user experience.

### How to Right Size?

The process typically involves:
1. **Monitoring and Analyzing Usage**: Utilize AWS CloudWatch to monitor metrics like CPU and memory utilization.
2. **Identifying Underused Resources**: Look for instances with consistent low utilization using AWS Cost Explorer.
3. **Testing**: Before finalizing the size, test different configurations to find the best balance between performance and cost.

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Gather Current Utilization Data

Use AWS CloudWatch to monitor your instances over a representative period (ideally, a few weeks).

```bash
aws cloudwatch get-metric-statistics --metric-name CPUUtilization --start-time 2023-01-01T00:00:00Z --end-time 2023-01-15T23:59:00Z --period 86400 --namespace AWS/EC2 --statistics Average --dimensions Name=InstanceId,Value=i-1234567890abcdef0
```

### Step 2: Analyze the Data

Utilize AWS Cost Explorer to review historical usage and identify any instances that are consistently underutilized.

```bash
aws ce get-reservation-utilization --time-period Start=2023-01-01,End=2023-01-31
```

### Step 3: Test Different Configurations

Clone your environment and deploy various instance sizes or families to determine the optimal configuration.

### Step 4: Implement Changes

Once you've identified the best instance type and size, update your environment. This can be done manually through the AWS Management Console or using Infrastructure as Code tools like AWS CloudFormation:

```yaml
Resources:
  MyEC2Instance:
    Type: 'AWS::EC2::Instance'
    Properties:
      InstanceType: t3.medium
      ImageId: ami-0abcdef1234567890
```

## Best Practices & Pitfalls

**Best Practices:**
1. **Regularly Review Usage**: Set up a regular schedule to review and adjust sizes as needed.
2. **Leverage Auto Scaling**: Use auto scaling to automatically adjust capacity and maintain performance and cost.
3. **Employ AWS Compute Optimizer**: This tool can provide recommendations based on past usage and performance.

**Common Pitfalls:**
1. **Ignoring Storage Costs**: While focusing on compute resources, don't forget about associated storage costs.
2. **Over-Optimization**: Overly aggressive downscaling can lead to performance issues.
3. **Not Accounting for Peak Loads**: Ensure your sizing accounts for peak usage times, not just average use.

## Real-world Mistakes

1. **Leaving Unused EBS Volumes**: After terminating instances, unused EBS volumes can accrue costs if not deleted.
2. **Misconfigured Auto Scaling**: Incorrect thresholds or limits can lead to ineffective scaling, affecting both cost and performance.
3. **Not Using Savings Plans**: Committing to Savings Plans for consistent baseline usage can significantly reduce costs.

## Hands-on Assignment

### Objective:
Optimize the cost of a currently running EC2 instance by right sizing.

### Steps:
1. **Identify an Instance**: Choose an EC2 instance in your account that has been running for at least 1 month.
2. **Analyze Usage**: Use CloudWatch to analyze the CPU and memory usage of this instance for the last month.
3. **Determine a Better Fit**: Based on the usage data, identify a more appropriately sized instance type.
4. **Test the New Instance**: Launch a new EC2 instance with the identified type and migrate a small portion of traffic or load to it.
5. **Monitor and Compare**: Monitor the performance and cost of the new instance for one week.
6. **Document Results**: Create a report comparing the performance and cost between the original and new instance types.

### Deliverable:
Submit your findings in a report outlining potential cost savings, performance metrics, and recommendations for further optimizations.

This practical exercise will provide a hands-on experience in EC2 right sizing, emphasizing the importance of continuous monitoring and optimization in cloud resource management.
