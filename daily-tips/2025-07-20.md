# AWS Cost Tip - 2025-07-20
**Topic:** EC2
**Subtopic:** Right Sizing

## Introduction

Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) is a central piece of Amazon's cloud computing platform, AWS, providing resizable compute capacity in the cloud. Efficient management of EC2 instances is crucial for optimizing cloud costs, with "Right Sizing" being a particularly effective strategy. Right sizing involves analyzing and modifying your instances to ensure that you are running the optimal instance type and size for your application, balancing performance and cost. This can lead to significant financial savings, especially in environments where resources are either underutilized or over-provisioned.

## Deep Dive

### Understanding Right Sizing

**Right sizing** is the process of matching instance types and sizes to your workload performance and capacity requirements at the lowest possible cost. Hereâ€™s why and how:

- **Why:** Many EC2 instances are either too large or too small for their workloads, leading to unnecessary costs or poor performance. Right sizing helps maximize the efficiency of cloud resources.
- **How:** It involves monitoring and analyzing the performance metrics of your instances, such as CPU utilization, memory usage, and network traffic, to identify misalignments between allocated resources and actual usage.

### Example

Consider a scenario where an EC2 instance of `m5.2xlarge` is deployed for a web application. Over time, monitoring reveals that CPU utilization peaks at only 20%, and average memory usage is about 8 GB out of 32 GB available. This is a clear indication that the instance is oversized for its workload.

## Implementation Steps

### Step-by-Step Guide to Right Sizing EC2 Instances

1. **Collect Performance Metrics**:
   - Use Amazon CloudWatch to gather data on CPU, memory, disk I/O, and network metrics.
   - Set up detailed monitoring to collect data at one-minute intervals for more granular insights.

2. **Analyze Performance Data**:
   - Assess the utilization metrics to determine if the current instance size is appropriate.
   - Look for patterns like consistently low CPU or memory usage.

3. **Identify Suitable Instance Types**:
   - Use the AWS Instance Type Matrix to compare different types and sizes.
   - Consider newer generation instances as they might offer better price-performance ratios.

4. **Test with Different Sizes**:
   - Implement changes in a staging environment to compare performance against the baseline.

5. **Automate Right Sizing Using AWS Compute Optimizer**:
   - Enable AWS Compute Optimizer for your account.
   - Review the instance recommendations provided based on your usage patterns.

6. **Implement Changes**:
   - Modify instance types and sizes either manually through the AWS Management Console or programmatically using AWS CLI or SDKs.
   - Use Infrastructure as Code for systematic changes across environments (example snippet for Terraform below):

    ```terraform
    resource "aws_instance" "right_sized_instance" {
        ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
        instance_type = "m5.large"  # Adjusted based on recommendations
        key_name      = "your-key"
        ...
    }
    ```

### Confirm and Monitor:
   - Once deployed, continue to monitor the new instance to ensure performance meets expectations without overspending.

## Best Practices, Pitfalls & Real-World Examples

### Best Practices

- Regularly review and adjust your EC2 instances as workloads change over time.
- Leverage AWS tools like AWS Cost Explorer and AWS Compute Optimizer for ongoing optimization insights.

### Common Pitfalls

- **Over-provisioning:** Avoid setting up larger instances than needed "just in case".
- **Ignoring I/O and network performance:** Focusing solely on CPU and memory can lead to suboptimal performance if disk I/O and network are bottlenecks.

### Real-World Example

A company once continued to run multiple `m4.xlarge` instances for an application even after the workload had significantly decreased. This oversight led to a 40% overspend on EC2 costs, which was identified and corrected only during an annual audit.

## Hands-on Assignment

### Objective

Optimize the cost of a currently running `m5.2xlarge` instance by right sizing it based on actual usage.

### Steps

1. **Set Up Monitoring**:
   - Ensure that detailed monitoring is enabled on your target instance.
   - Collect data for at least one week.

2. **Analyse the Data**:
   - Review the CloudWatch metrics for CPU, memory, and network usage.

3. **Identify the Optimal Size**:
   - Based on the data, choose an appropriate smaller instance type.

4. **Test the New Instance**:
   - Launch a new EC2 instance with the identified type in the same VPC.
   - Redirect a portion of traffic to the new instance.

5. **Evaluate Performance**:
   - Compare the performance of both instances under similar load conditions.

6. **Implement the Change**:
   - If satisfied with the performance, start routing all traffic to the new instance and decommission the old one.

### Deliverables

- A brief report documenting the performance data, your analysis, decisions made, and the outcomes observed.

This practical exercise will help you gain hands-on experience in right sizing an EC2 instance, reinforcing the concepts discussed and providing real-world skills in AWS cost optimization.
