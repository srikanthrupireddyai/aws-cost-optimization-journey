# Tip #1 – Over-Provisioning EC2 Instances

Many organizations overestimate their EC2 instance size, leading to high idle capacity and wasted spend.

## Why it happens
- Developers choose instance types larger than needed “just in case”.
- Workloads are not benchmarked before production.
- Lack of visibility into resource usage (e.g., CloudWatch).

## How to Fix
1. **Enable Compute Optimizer** to get ML-based right-sizing suggestions.
2. **Use T-Series (Burstable Instances)** for dev/test:
   - These instances provide baseline CPU with the ability to burst.
   - Cost-effective for workloads with low average CPU use.
3. **Leverage Savings Plans** for predictable workloads.
4. **Use Auto-Scaling with mixed instance policies (incl. Spot)**.

## What are Spot Instances?
Spot Instances let you use spare AWS capacity at a 70–90% discount. Ideal for non-critical or fault-tolerant workloads.

## Assignment
- Enable Compute Optimizer.
- Identify 2 EC2 instances in your account.
- Record current type, CPU usage, and potential downsizing opportunity.
