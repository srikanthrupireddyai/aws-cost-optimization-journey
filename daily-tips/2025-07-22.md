# AWS Cost Tip - 2025-07-22
**Topic:** EC2
**Subtopic:** Instance Scheduling

**Introduction**

Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) is a fundamental piece of AWS's cloud computing platform, and efficient management of EC2 instances is critical for optimizing cloud costs. One effective cost optimization strategy is Instance Scheduling, which involves starting and stopping EC2 instances based on usage patterns to avoid running servers during idle hours. This practice is particularly useful for development and test environments that are not required to operate 24/7, potentially leading to significant cost savings.

**Deep Dive**

### Why Instance Scheduling?

EC2 instances are billed by the second, with a minimum of 60 seconds. If instances are left running without being used, especially outside of business hours, it leads directly to unnecessary spending. By scheduling instances to only operate when needed, you can cut down on costs dramatically.

### How Does Instance Scheduling Work?

Instance Scheduling involves setting up automated start and stop times for your EC2 instances based on predefined schedules. This can be achieved using various tools and scripts, such as AWS Lambda functions triggered by Amazon CloudWatch events.

For example, consider an instance used typically during the standard work hours of 9 AM to 5 PM on weekdays. Outside these hours, the instance can be stopped, effectively cutting down the operational hours from 168 to 40 hours per week â€“ a reduction of over 75% in running hours.

**Implementation Steps**

### Step 1: Identify the Instances for Scheduling

Analyze your EC2 usage to identify which instances can be scheduled. Instances used for production, which require high availability, might not be suitable for scheduling.

### Step 2: Create IAM Role and Policy

Create an IAM role that allows Lambda to interact with EC2 instances. Attach a policy with permissions to start and stop EC2 instances.

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ec2:StartInstances",
                "ec2:StopInstances"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

### Step 3: Set Up AWS Lambda Function

Create a Lambda function that will trigger the start and stop of instances based on the CloudWatch event schedule.

```python
import boto3

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    ec2 = boto3.client('ec2', region_name='your-region')
    instances = ['instance-id-1', 'instance-id-2']

    if event['detail-type'] == 'Scheduled Event Start':
        ec2.start_instances(InstanceIds=instances)
    elif event['detail-type'] == 'Scheduled Event Stop':
        ec2.stop_instances(InstanceIds=instances)
```

### Step 4: Schedule CloudWatch Events

Create two CloudWatch Events that trigger on a schedule to start instances at 9 AM and stop them at 5 PM on weekdays.

```plaintext
cron(0 9 ? * MON-FRI *)
cron(0 17 ? * MON-FRI *)
```

**Best Practices, Pitfalls & Real-World Examples**

### Best Practices

- **Audit Regularly**: Regularly review your instance schedules and usage to align them with actual business needs.
- **Leverage Resource Tagging**: Tag instances to manage and identify scheduled instances easily.
- **Monitor Performance**: Ensure that the scheduled starts and stops do not affect the performance or availability of applications.

### Common Pitfalls

- **Time Zone Confusion**: Always set the correct time zone for your CloudWatch Events to avoid off-by-one-hour errors.
- **Overlooking Dependencies**: Ensure dependent services or databases are also handled when instances are stopped or started.

### Real-World Example

A common mistake is forgetting to consider attached EBS volumes, which continue to accrue charges even when the EC2 instance is stopped. Always include a cost-benefit analysis of keeping EBS volumes available versus re-creating them as needed.

**Hands-on Assignment**

### Objective

Set up a basic EC2 instance scheduling using AWS Lambda and CloudWatch Events.

### Steps

1. **Launch an EC2 Instance**: If you don't have one, launch a t2.micro instance which is eligible for the free tier.
2. **Implement the IAM Role and Policy**: Follow the steps above to create suitable roles and policies.
3. **Deploy the Lambda Function**: Use the provided Python script, adjusting the region and instance IDs as needed.
4. **Create CloudWatch Event Rules**: Set up the start and stop schedules using the cron expressions provided.
5. **Monitor and Verify**: Check the EC2 console to ensure that the instance starts and stops according to the schedule.

By completing this assignment, you'll gain hands-on experience with EC2 instance scheduling, providing practical insights into how this method can be used to reduce AWS costs.
